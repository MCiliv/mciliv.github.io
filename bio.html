		<p>
	I love bio. Bio tells the story of life and a bio tells the story of someone's life. I'm about life and I'm also about peoples lives. I love to help out others but I also love learning about how we work. <br>
	How about what I just said? What was my process of thinking? This is where
algorithms come to play in my game of life. Algorithms are what allow us to play the game, to have a controller into the way that life works and into taking
control in our lives through consciousness.<br>
	I'm conscious, or at least conscious that I'm learning everyday, so that
I can better live and better give.
