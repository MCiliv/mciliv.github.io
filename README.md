This website is my personal website which can also be accessed from

http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~mciliv01/

1.  I have correctly implement the functionality of linking to my bio and
to my resume. I've included appropriate information. Everything is working
as intended so far, but I have a lot more I want to add and I want to fix
up the styling.

2.	I collaborated with Vincent Tsang and Jim Mao.

3. I spent about 12 hours completing the assingment.
